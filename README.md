ChatShift is a powerful Python-based tool for exporting Telegram chats into various text formats. With its elegant and modern terminal interface, ChatShift makes it easy to export single or multiple chats, download media files, and generate detailed statistics about your conversations.

## Features

- Export Telegram chats to multiple formats (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Simple, Custom)
- Multiple chat export in a single operation
- Export statistics and summaries
- Media downloading with filtering options
- Clean and intuitive command-line interface
- Customizable export options
- Support for various message types (text, media, links, etc.)
- Real-time progress updates during export
- Performance optimizations for faster processing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosaddiX/chatshift.git
cd chatshift
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Telegram API credentials:
```
TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_api_id
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash
TELEGRAM_PHONE=your_phone_number
OUTPUT_FILE=telegram_chat_export.txt
MESSAGE_LIMIT=0  # 0 for all messages
```

You can obtain your Telegram API credentials by creating an application at https://my.telegram.org/apps

For detailed installation instructions, see [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python chatshift.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to select and export your chats.

For testing the application, see [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).

### Multiple Chat Export

To export multiple chats at once:
1. Select option 4 "Export multiple chats" from the action menu
2. Select the chats you want to export by entering their numbers
3. Use 'v' to view all selected chats in a table format
4. Enter 'd' when you're done selecting
5. Configure your export options

The multiple chat selection interface now shows a clean, streamlined view that avoids duplicating the list of selected chats after each selection. Instead, it shows:
- A confirmation message when a chat is added
- The current count of selected chats in the prompt
- A reminder to use 'v' to view all selected chats periodically

### Export Statistics

After exporting a chat, you can generate statistics about the exported messages:
- Message counts by type (text, media, service)
- Media counts by type (photos, videos, documents, audio)
- Top message senders
- Date range and messages per day
